### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with the following technologies:

- **PDF Processing:** PyPDF2 (for merging), WeasyPrint (for HTML to PDF)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Jinja2 templates)
- **Server:** WSGI / Flask development server

### üöÄ How It Works

This is a multi-functional web application:

PDF Merging: Users upload multiple PDFs. The backend uses PdfMerger from PyPDF2 to combine the files, which are then returned as a download.

HTML to PDF Conversion: Users upload an HTML file. The server injects necessary CSS to correctly style Jupyter Notebook exports, then uses WeasyPrint to render a PDF.
